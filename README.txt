== Description ==

Custom Posts and Block Pattern plugin for Clashvibes Theme.

=== Installing ===

1. To use these exercise files, you must have the following installed:
   - WordPress
   - Node and NPM
2. Clone this repository to the `/wp-content/plugins/` folder of your local WordPress installation using the terminal (Mac), CMD (Windows), or a GUI tool like SourceTree.
3. Run `npm install` in terminal to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run start` to start the development process.
5. In WordPress, activate the "clashvibes-plugin" plugin.

=== Quick Start ===

Clone or download this repository, change its name to something else (like, say, `megatherium-is-awesome`), and then you'll need to do a six-step find and replace on the name in all the templates.

1. Search for `'clashvibes-plugin'` (inside single quotations) to capture the text domain and replace with: `'megatherium-is-awesome'`.
2. Search for `clashvibes-plugin` to capture all the functions names and replace with: `megatherium_is_awesome_`.
3. Search for `Text Domain: clashvibes-plugin` in `style.css` and replace with: `Text Domain: megatherium-is-awesome`.
4. Search for <code>&nbsp;clashvibes-plugin</code> (with a space before it) to capture DocBlocks and replace with: <code>&nbsp;Megatherium_is_Awesome</code>.
5. Search for `clashvibes-plugin-` to capture prefixed handles and replace with: `megatherium-is-awesome-`.
6. Search for `CLASHVIBES-PLUGIN` (in uppercase) to capture constants and replace with: `MEGATHERIUM_IS_AWESOME_`.

Then, update the stylesheet header in `style.css`, the links in `footer.php` with your own information and rename `clashvibes-plugin.pot` from `languages` folder to use the theme's slug. Next, update or delete this readme.
